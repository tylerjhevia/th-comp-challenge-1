# th-comp-challenge-1

For this project, I created a responsive web page modeled after this comp:

Here is a link to my page on GitHub pages: https://tylerjhevia.github.io/th-comp-challenge-1/

I decided to make my page about bears. I used two break points, one at (max-width = 780px) and one at (max-width = 400px). 
This is what my page looks like when window width > 780px: <img width="1032" alt="th-static-comp-1-normal-view" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25699277/26368676/8b3dac30-3faf-11e7-9a87-8d7b9253470e.png">
