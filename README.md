# th-comp-challenge-1

For this project, I used flexbox to create a responsive web page modeled after this comp:

Here is a link to my page on GitHub pages: https://tylerjhevia.github.io/th-comp-challenge-1/

I decided to make my page about bears. I used two break points, one at (max-width = 780px) and one at (max-width = 400px). 

This is what my page looks like when window width > 780px: <img width="1032" alt="th-static-comp-1-normal-view" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25699277/26368676/8b3dac30-3faf-11e7-9a87-8d7b9253470e.png">

This is what it looks like after the first break point (at maxwidth=780px) before scrolling down: <img width="745" alt="static-com-1-first-breakpoint" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25699277/26369978/934a5d2a-3fb3-11e7-8643-2abe6154132a.png">

And this is what it looks like after the second break point (at maxwidth=400px) before scrolling down: <img width="396" alt="static-com-1-second-breakpoint" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25699277/26370078/f32a76a8-3fb3-11e7-8332-a9cbf5cbef52.png">
